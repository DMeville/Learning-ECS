Trying to learn how to use pure ECS in Unity. Many of the tutorials on youtube and documentation are out of date so I've been stumbling through it. Keeping a record as I work through learning.

# Using
- Unity 2019.1.0b5
- Entities preview.29 - 0.0.12
- Hybrid Renderer preview.9 - 0.0.1
- Burst preview.6 - 1.0.0

# 01-SpawnAndRender
Sets up bootstrap that creates a bunch of entities, and renders them.

# 02-Archetypes
Same thing, but uses archetypes when instantiating entities
