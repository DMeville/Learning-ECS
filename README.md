Trying to learn how to use pure ECS in Unity. Many of the tutorials on youtube and documentation are out of date so I've been stumbling through it.

Using 2019.1.0b5
Entities preview.29 - 0.0.12
Hybrid Renderer preview.9 - 0.0.1
Burst preview.6 - 1.0.0

[h1]01-SpawnAndRender[/h1]
Sets up bootstrap that creates a bunch of entities, and renders them.
